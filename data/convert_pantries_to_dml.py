"""Converts all pantries listed in pantries.csv to SQL insert commands.

Note that this does not handle pantries that have multiple open
hour ranges in a single day, defined in their comments section.
For those pantries, manual creation of the DDL commands inserting the
data into the pantry_hours table is required.

Also make note here that I am manually inserting the "id" field for each entry.
Even though we have defined in our schema that PostgreSQL will automatically
serialize this field if an entry does not specify "id" when inserting, this
doesn't stop duplicate entries. Basically, if two entries specify the exact
same (url, name, ..., created_at) upon entry, as might be the case in an
accidental duplicate insert command, PostgreSQL will allow the insertion with
a serialized ID. So, here I specify the "id" field alongside the
ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING modifier when inserting to prevent accidentally inserting
a duplicate entry.
